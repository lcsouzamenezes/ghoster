# Ghoster

Try it on http://maxwellito.github.io/ghoster

Ghoster a little script to remove the white color from a greyscale picture to make it transparent. I never managed to do this correctly on Photoshop until I realised JavaScript and canvas could make my life easier.

Don't take this script too seriously, this is a little hack. But happy to talk for future improvements (better algorithm, make it work with multicolor pictures...)

## How to use it?

- Go on the [demo page](http://maxwellito.github.io/ghoster)
- Drag and drop your grayscale picture on the page
- Right click > Save image as
